          Bit-z-Bots is a web application for customizing and creating miniature 3D-printed robot figurines.
           Cute and unassuming, a Bit-z-Bot's noble purpose in its 3D-fabricated life is to inspire children's (and adults'!) interest 
           in creative technology.

          <a href="magic_neural_net.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magic Neural Net</a> is a simple, JavaScript composed neural network acting as a Magic 8-Ball to lend
          pseudo-random, yet by definition 'intelligent', fortunes. The net utilizes a random input of combinations involving 0 and/or 1 to solve the XOR equation, which is used to determine whether 
          two inputs differ. Interestingly, the classic Magic 8-Ball already has 'edge case' fortunes built in, which are used as fallback answers in case the code
          encounters a runtime issue.

          If the inputs differ, the network yields an output close to 1, which I mapped to yield a binary result of good (closer to 1) or bad fortune (closer to 0).
          This is a playful exercise in training a neural network and applying sophisticated, intelligent code to a basically meaningless end, mimicking a Magic 8-Ball, which does not actually use
          input about your situation to intelligently predict fortune.

            Programmers spend enough time debugging. The Bugging is a playful exercise for the programmer to practice and solidify her 
            knowledge in object-oriented programming (OOP) while creating colorful "bugs". The Bugging involves algorithmically generating 
            bugs with randomly selected, inheritable attributes (e.g. wing/eye color, pattern, body detail, number of legs) and methods 
            (e.g. movement, size growth). The project will eventually implement Mendelian genetics principles in algorithms to dictate 
            offsprings' inheritance of said bug qualities.

        <img src="static/sitmigbugging3.gif" class="the_bugging_img" alt="digital bug generation">
        <div class="project-info">
            The original The Bugging playfully employs Python's Turtle module, which is traditionally used to teach OOP, by imagining 
            a digital turtle has attributes of position, direction and shape, and methods of movement. It drags its tail (which is 
            dipped in colorful paint) across the computer screen, to the programmer's (or program's) whim.

        <div class="project-info">
            The Bugging has classes of bugs including "Scarab", "Lady", "Snail" and "Widow" which live in a digital world where their 
            attributes can be inherited by hybrid offspring. A side effect of the practical exercise, The Bugging, is beautiful 
            randomized, algorithmically generated art that--if not screencast---lasts in ephemerality, mimicking the often short 
            lifespans of insects.

          "Monster Women" is an ongoing series inspired by the kitsch 1980's toys, "Invasion of the Monster Women", which feature

          from The Odyssey to 1960's sci-fi B movies, I've been fascinated by the vilification of femme sexuality and the
