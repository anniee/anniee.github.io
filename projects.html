          Bit-z-Bots is a web application for customizing and creating miniature 3D-printed robot figurines.
           Cute and unassuming, a Bit-z-Bot's noble purpose in its 3D-fabricated life is to inspire children's (and adults'!) interest 
           in creative technology.

          Bit-z-Bots has been remade in iterations, culminating in an <a href="exhibitions.html">exhibition</a> at 
          Maker Faire SF 2017, where children designed and 3D-printed their figurines.

          Children are impressionable, and toys are an effective medium for education, so for my first programming 
          project, I wanted to create something that encouraged all kids' interest in technology, and especially empowered little girls to 
          make their own figurines.</div>

          Angelena Atlas, founded by Leana Scott and built by women, is a crowdsourced map of intersectional 
          feminist resources and spaces in Los Angeles. I am contributing web development and skillsharing with other members of the 
          Women's Center for Creative Work to create a sustainable and empowering application. We hope to make various social justice 
          efforts (e.g. anti-racist, anti-incarceration, pro-LGBTQIA2S+) more visible and thus accessible to members of our community.

          Postscripta is a text-to-handwriting application that uses my dad's handwriting post-developing MS for easier, personalized 
          assistive electronic communication. Typing and other electronic forms of communication are easiest for people with neurodegenerative disorder
          based motor impairment to use, but often de-personalized for functionality.

            The potential applications of Postscripta go beyond re-personalization of assistance for those affected by neurodegenerative disorders. 
            Postscripta in future iterations could be used for preservation and celebration of anything, for instance, to make font for modern-day 
            recipe cards out of a great-grandmother’s handwriting.
